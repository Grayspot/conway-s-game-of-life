# Conway's Game of Life  
## The game is written in Java using AWT library.  
The main purpose of the project is not just recreating the game, but doing so while using Object-oriented design patterns, such as visitor, observer, state, etc.
Other than that, the game contains different rulesets that can be changed mid-simulation, as well as a few interesting patterns.
Detailed description can be found in the user manual.
